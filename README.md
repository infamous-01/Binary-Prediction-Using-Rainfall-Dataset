# Binary-Prediction-Using-Rainfall-Dataset

Built an ensemble model to predict daily rainfall, achieving 87% accuracy and 0.902 ROC AUC. Improved rain recall from 0.62 to 0.67 using class imbalance techniques for better rare event prediction. Applied early stopping (50 rounds) and validated with log loss, PR curves, and confusion matrices to avoid overfitting. Engineered 10+ features (e.g., pressure trends, humidity-cloud interactions) to capture key weather patterns and optimize model performance.
